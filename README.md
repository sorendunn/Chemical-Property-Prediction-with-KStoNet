## Chemical Property Prediction with K-StoNets

**Abstract**: Kernel-expanded stochastic neural networks (K-StoNets) have several useful theoretical properties including (under certain assumptions) not having any local minima and having universal approximation ability even for small networks. However, little work has yet been done on evaluating the empirical importance of each of the model components of K-StoNets in the context of a real-world prediction problem. In this project, I investigate the importance of the support vector regression (SVR) layer, hidden layer(s), added noise, and SVR hyper-parameter choice in StoNets for model convergence and performance in the context of predicting activity of chemicals in inhibiting HIV replication using extended connectivity fingerprints.
